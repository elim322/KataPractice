- [PersistentBugger](./PersistentBugger.js)

  Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive
  parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence,
  which is the number of times you must multiply the digits
  in num until you reach a single digit.

  ```
  persistence(39)
  -> 3 * 9 = 27
    -> 2 * 7 = 14
      -> 1 * 4 = 4  <- single digit

   result = 3 Iterations
  ```
